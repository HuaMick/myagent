# Requirements Document

This document outlines the requirements for a proof-of-concept (PoC) Cursor IDE extension. The extension will serve as a front-end to a set of web-hosted Python APIs. The primary goal is to demonstrate a specific workflow: using a command to send a requirements document and an instructions document to an AI, which then generates a Product Requirements Document (PRD) that is saved locally.

## 1. Project Goals and Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: To validate the end-to-end workflow of using a configuration file to send multiple source documents to a backend AI service and saving the generated file output.
- **Objective 1 (PoC)**: Develop a minimal viable product (MVP) that executes this specific PRD generation task.
- **Objective 2**: Create a simple, command-based user interface within the Cursor IDE.
- **Objective 3**: Define a clear and efficient data contract (API) between the Cursor extension and the backend Python APIs for this task.

## 2. Scope

### 2.1. In-Scope

- A single command palette entry to trigger the PRD generation process.
- A configuration file (e.g., `myagent.config.json` in the workspace root) to specify the input requirements file, the instructions file, and the output file path.
- Functionality to read the contents of the two input files specified in the configuration.
- Functionality to send the contents of both files to a specified backend API endpoint.
- Functionality to receive a generated PRD from the backend.
- Functionality to save the response to the output file path specified in the configuration.
- The backend will be a set of web-hosted Python APIs (the creation of these APIs is out of scope for the extension, but their interface will be a dependency).

### 2.2. Out-of-Scope (for this PoC)

- Any UI other than a single command palette entry.
- Dynamic prompt generation or user input.
- Handling more than the two specified input files.
- User authentication, authorization, or advanced error handling.
- The implementation of the backend Python APIs and the AI model itself.
- Offline functionality.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. FR-001: Read Configuration

- **Description**: Before execution, the extension must read a configuration file from the workspace root to determine the input and output files.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The extension looks for a `myagent.config.json` file in the user's workspace root.
  - The configuration file must contain `inputFile`, `instructionsFile`, and `outputFile` keys.
  - If the config file or any of the keys do not exist, an informative error message is shown.

### 3.2. FR-002: Activate Extension

- **Description**: The user shall activate the extension's core feature via a single command.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - A single command is available in the command palette (e.g., "Generate PRD from requirements").

### 3.3. FR-003: Send Files Content

- **Description**: When activated, the extension reads the content of the two input files and sends them to the backend.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The extension reads the file paths from the `myagent.config.json` file.
  - The full content of both input files is read into memory.
  - The contents are sent in a structured payload to the configured backend API endpoint.

### 3.4. FR-004: Receive and Process Response

- **Description**: The extension must handle the generated PRD content from the backend API.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The extension successfully receives an HTTP response.
  - The response containing the generated PRD is parsed correctly.

### 3.5. FR-005: Save Output File

- **Description**: The extension must save the received content to the specified output file.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The generated content is saved to the `outputFile` path specified in `myagent.config.json`.
  - If the file already exists, it is overwritten. If it doesn't exist, it is created.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001 (Usability)**: The command should be easy to discover and use.
- **NFR-002 (Performance)**: The end-to-end process should complete within a reasonable time.
- **NFR-003 (Configuration)**: The URL of the backend API should be configurable in the extension's settings.

## 5. Technology Stack (Assumed)

- **Frontend**: TypeScript (for the Cursor Extension)
- **Backend Interface**: RESTful API (JSON payload)

## 6. Assumptions and Dependencies

- A functional, web-accessible Python backend API exists and its endpoint URL is known.
- The backend API expects a specific JSON structure for the request (e.g., `{"requirements_content": "...", "instructions_content": "..."}`).
- The backend API returns a specific JSON structure for the response (e.g., `{"prd_content": "..."}`).
- The user has the Cursor IDE installed and a stable internet connection.
- The user has a `myagent.config.json` file in their workspace root with the correct structure.
