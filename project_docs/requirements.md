# Requirements Document

This document outlines the requirements for a proof-of-concept (PoC) Cursor IDE extension. The extension will serve as a front-end interface to a set of web-hosted Python APIs. The primary goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of a system where a user can select a file in the IDE, send its contents along with a pre-canned prompt to an AI service via a backend API, receive a response, and have the extension automatically apply the suggested changes back to the file.

## 1. Project Goals and Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: To validate the end-to-end workflow of sending file content from a Cursor extension to a backend AI service and applying the returned modifications to the original file.
- **Objective 1 (PoC)**: Develop a minimal viable product (MVP) to prove the concept.
- **Objective 2**: Create a user-friendly interface within the Cursor IDE for invoking the functionality.
- **Objective 3**: Establish a clear and efficient communication channel between the Cursor extension and the backend Python APIs.

## 2. Scope

### 2.1. In-Scope

- A Cursor extension with a single command palette entry to trigger the process.
- A configuration file (e.g., `ai-refactor.json` in the workspace root) to specify the target file.
- Functionality to read the file path from the configuration file.
- Functionality to get the content of the specified file.
- Functionality to send the file content and a pre-defined prompt to a specified backend API endpoint.
- Functionality to receive a response from the backend.
- Functionality to apply the response to the file specified in the configuration file.
- The backend will be a set of web-hosted Python APIs (the creation of these APIs is out of scope for the extension, but their interface will be a dependency).

### 2.2. Out-of-Scope (for this PoC)

- Complex UI for prompt engineering or selection. Only pre-canned/hardcoded prompts will be used.
- Handling multiple files at once.
- User authentication or authorization.
- Advanced error handling and reporting.
- The implementation of the backend Python APIs and the AI model itself. We assume these are provided and functional.
- Offline functionality.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. FR-001: Read Configuration

- **Description**: Before execution, the extension must read a configuration file from the workspace root to determine the target file.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The extension looks for a `ai-refactor.json` file in the user's workspace root.
  - The configuration file must contain a key `filePath` with a relative path to the file to be processed (e.g., `{"filePath": "src/my-file.js"}`).
  - If the file or the `filePath` key does not exist, an informative error message is shown to the user.

### 3.2. FR-002: Activate Extension

- **Description**: The user shall be able to activate the extension's core feature via a single command.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - A single command is available in the command palette (e.g., "Refactor File based on ai-refactor.json").

### 3.3. FR-003: Send File Content

- **Description**: When activated, the extension must read the entire content of the file specified in the configuration file.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The extension correctly reads the file path from the `ai-refactor.json` configuration file.
  - The full content of the specified file is read into memory.
  - The file content, along with a hardcoded prompt, is sent as a payload in an HTTP request to the configured backend API endpoint.

### 3.4. FR-004: Receive and Process Response

- **Description**: The extension must handle the response from the backend API.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The extension can successfully receive an HTTP response.
  - The response, containing the modified file content, is parsed correctly.

### 3.5. FR-005: Apply Changes to File

- **Description**: The extension must update the file specified in the configuration with the content received from the backend.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The entire content of the file specified in `ai-refactor.json` is replaced with the new content from the API response.
  - The change is saved directly to the file on disk.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001 (Usability)**: The feature should be easy to discover and use for a developer within Cursor.
- **NFR-002 (Performance)**: The interaction (send and receive) should ideally complete within a few seconds to avoid a long waiting time for the user. This is dependent on the backend API performance.
- **NFR-003 (Configuration)**: The URL of the backend API should be configurable within the extension's settings.

## 5. Technology Stack (Assumed)

- **Frontend**: TypeScript (for the Cursor Extension)
- **Backend Interface**: RESTful API (JSON payload)

## 6. Assumptions and Dependencies

- A functional, web-accessible Python backend API exists and its endpoint URL is known.
- The backend API expects a specific JSON structure for the request (e.g., `{"file_content": "...", "prompt": "..."}`).
- The backend API returns a specific JSON structure for the response (e.g., `{"new_content": "..."}`).
- The user has the Cursor IDE installed.
- A stable internet connection is available.
