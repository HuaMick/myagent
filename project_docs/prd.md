## Initial description of the product

This project is a proof-of-concept Cursor IDE extension that serves as a front-end to a web-hosted Python API. Its primary function is to execute a specific workflow: a user triggers a command that reads a requirements document and an instructions document (as specified in a config file), sends them to an AI service, and saves the resulting Product Requirements Document (PRD) to a local file.

## Assumptions

*   A functional, web-accessible Python backend API exists, and its endpoint URL is known.
*   The backend API has a specific, known JSON structure for both requests and responses.
*   The user has the Cursor IDE installed with a stable internet connection.
*   A `myagent.config.json` file is present in the workspace root and correctly configured with paths for the input and output files.

## Goals

*   **G1:** Validate the end-to-end workflow of sending multiple source documents from a Cursor extension to a backend AI service based on a configuration file.
*   **G2:** Successfully save the generated file output from the AI service to the local filesystem.
*   **G3:** Develop a minimal viable product (MVP) that proves the concept for this specific PRD generation task.
*   **G4:** Provide a simple, discoverable command-based user interface within the Cursor IDE.

## User Stories

*   **US1 (Developer):** As a Developer, I want to define my input (`requirements.md`, `instructions.mdc`) and output (`prd.md`) files in a single `myagent.config.json` file and trigger a command, so that the extension automatically generates a PRD without further interaction.
*   **US2 (Developer):** As a Developer, if the configuration file is missing or malformed, I want the extension to show me a clear error message so I can easily fix it.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Configuration
*   **FR1.1:** The system must read a configuration file named `myagent.config.json` from the workspace root upon execution.
*   **FR1.2:** The configuration file must contain three keys: `inputFile`, `instructionsFile`, and `outputFile`, with string values representing their paths.
*   **FR1.3:** The system must show an informative error message and halt execution if the configuration file or any of the required keys are missing.

### 2. Execution
*   **FR2.1:** The system must expose a single command in the Cursor command palette, such as "Generate PRD from requirements".
*   **FR2.2:** When triggered, the system must read the full contents of the two files specified by `inputFile` and `instructionsFile`.
*   **FR2.3:** The system must send the contents of these two files within a structured JSON payload to the pre-configured backend API endpoint.
    > ⚠️ **TBC:** The exact structure of the JSON payload needs to be finalized (e.g., `{"requirements_content": "...", "instructions_content": "..."}`).

### 3. Output Handling
*   **FR3.1:** The system must successfully receive and parse the HTTP response from the backend.
*   **FR3.2:** The system must write the received content to the file path specified in the `outputFile` key.
*   **FR3.3:** If the output file already exists, it should be overwritten. If it does not exist, it should be created.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Frontend
*   **TR1.1:** The Cursor extension must be developed using TypeScript.

### 2. Backend Interface
*   **TR2.1:** Communication with the backend must use a RESTful API with JSON payloads.
*   **TR2.2:** The extension will mock API responses for development and testing purposes.

## Out of Scope

*   Any user interface beyond a single command palette entry.
*   Dynamic prompt generation.
*   Handling file types other than those specified in the configuration.
*   User authentication, authorization, and advanced error handling.
*   The implementation of the backend Python API and the AI model.
*   Offline functionality.
