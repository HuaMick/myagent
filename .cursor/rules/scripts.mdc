- All scripts should be designed to be run from the project root directory.
- Prefer using `npm` scripts in `package.json` for consistency.

## package.json scripts
Your `package.json` should contain scripts for common tasks.

```json
"scripts": {
  "vscode:prepublish": "npm run compile",
  "compile": "tsc -p ./",
  "watch": "tsc -watch -p ./",
  "lint": "eslint src --ext ts",
  "test": "jest"
},
```

## Shell Scripts
Shell scripts can be used for more complex orchestration, like setting up an environment before running tests. They should be placed in a `scripts/` directory.

### Example: Test execution script (`scripts/run-tests.sh`)
This script might set up environment variables before running `npm test`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set any environment variables needed for tests
# export MY_API_KEY="12345"

# Run tests using the npm script
npm test
```

### Example: Node execution script (`scripts/run-node.sh`)
Since nodes in a VSCode extension are run from within the editor, a direct execution script is less common. However, you might have scripts to build and package the extension.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script could be used to package your extension into a .vsix file

# Make sure vsce (Visual Studio Code Extensions) is installed
# npm install -g @vscode/vsce

echo "Packaging extension..."
vsce package
```
