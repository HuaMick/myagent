## Tools for Analysis

Please research and analyze the following tools:

1.  **Cursor IDE:** (As a baseline for comparison)
2.  **L-Agent**
3.  **void** (from https://github.com/voideditor/void)
4.  **Zed Editor**
5.  **TabbyML**
6.  **codecompanion.nvim**

## Research Objective

Compare each of the tools with cursor IDE. 
Also review their workflow capabilities. I am looking for all the features of cursor were we can have integrated human in the loop development but also agent worflows with granular level control of prompts.
